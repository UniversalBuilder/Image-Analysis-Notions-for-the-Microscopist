    "\n",
    "#### Image J\n",
    "\n",
    "**ImageJ** is an open-source image processing and analysis program written by Wayne Rasband. Without getting too much into the details, **it is the *de facto* software package bioimage analysts go to** for any kind of work related to microscopy and image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is written in java, is open-source and cross-platform, and can be extend by plugins also written in java. You can also write simpler macros in many languages like javascript, python (actually jython), and the native ImageJ1 macros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image J is also used as an addon to other programs to fulfill the image processing part, or is the base these software are built on. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fiji\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fiji is ImageJ + a collection of plugins**. While ImageJ is quite barebone and offers great tools, there are no specialized functions that could be of great ehlp in certains domains like biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fiji is tailored for bioimage analysts as it regroups a lot of useful plugins and functions made for the biologist first. It includes several algorithms to analyze cells, track vesicles, and read many microscopy image formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageJ plugins are small piece of software that can add functionality to ImageJ. They are **written in java** and packaged into a `.jar` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to know how to program in java and use the ImageJ API in order to write plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Macros\n",
    "\n",
    "Macros are different than plugins since since they do not require complex packaging nor knowing the full java language, and can be **boiled down to a series of ImageJ** commands that help you automate repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",

It has optimized algorithms to process these large files and has very advanced tools to identify cell types and tissue categories using machine learning.\n",
