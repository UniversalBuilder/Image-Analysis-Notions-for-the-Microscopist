    "Eclipse is an open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for programming in Java and other languages via plugins. Bio7 turns it into an IDE for environmental modeling studies. \n",

    "The learning curve is quite steep since **you have to know at least the Java and R programming languages in addition to image processing with ImageJ**, and the focus on ecology microscopists may not be familiar with. Nevertheless, for advanced users it can provide a very nice set of tools to do a complete analysis using just this one package."

    "Now that we have seen some of the most used tools in the domain, what's in for you ? **What's the purpose of this course ?** I will try to answer this question which is linked to the origin of this course (*if you're in a hurry you can skip this part and jump to the list below*):\n",

    "When I started writing this set of notebooks, my intent was first to share a few basic notions to explain some of the steps used in the Python scripts I was building.\n",
    "\n",
    "I quickly realized I should start from the beginning since many of the researchers I see have very little knowledge on what to do with their images. Moreover, the whole landscape of bioimage analysis is getting richer each day, with new tools arriving regularly and shaking up the establishment like ready-to-use deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I looked for where to point someone looking to learn and do bioimaging analyses, I couldn't find a satifying answer. Either the resources where much too specific (*very detailed instructions for one tool*), or just too broad (*if you look for image processing on the web you're likely to find anything from computer vision related books and courses to Photoshop tutorials for makeup artists*). \n",
    "\n",
    "So I decided to try to gather the best resources available, enrich them if needed, fill the voids if any, and package everything in a nice format. This is what you're looking at right now. \n",
